                    <h3>How We Store Your Information</h3>

                        The content you put in will be stored locally on your device.
                        In addition, we store your data backups in our services to protect the data

                    <!--h3>How you can access and control your information</h3>
                    <p class="file-content-p">
                        If you're already a Midinote user, you can manage your information simply by logging into
                        your account and editing your information directly within the Midinote service.
                    </p>
                    <p class="file-content-p">
                        Generally, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
                    </p>
                    <p class="file-content-p">
                        We may retain certain your information indefinitely,
                        unless you delete it or request its deletion.
                        For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user accounts,
                        so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely.
                    </p-->
